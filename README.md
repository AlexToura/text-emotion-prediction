#Emotion Classification Machine Learning Model

This project aims to design, implement, evaluate, and optimize a machine learning model for emotion classification. The goal is to train the model on a dataset containing documents labeled with emotions such as sadness, neutral, worry, happiness, fun, surprise, and hate. The project involves preprocessing the raw text data, experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, selecting optimal parameters, and combining classifiers to achieve the best predictive performance on unseen data.

#Learning Outcomes

Gain familiarity with experimental evaluation of machine learning models.
Learn data preprocessing techniques.
Practice writing a short technical report summarizing findings.
Gain experience in selecting parameters for machine learning models.
Understand the process of combining classifiers.
Address a real-world machine learning problem.


#Data
The dataset consists of documents labeled with emotions in raw text format. Preprocessing of the data is necessary to convert it into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

#Goal
Train, optimize, and evaluate the model on the provided dataset to achieve the highest predictive performance on new, unseen data.
